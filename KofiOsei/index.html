                <h2>The birth of Yaa Nimo's Son</h2>

                <p>
                     In January 1962, in a village in the Ashanti region called Ntotroso , a married woman called Yaa Nimo bore a newborn baby. In the old days in the Ashanti Region, children were not delivered in hospitals but at home by midwives. In the case of Yaa Nimo’s baby, there was a midwife but the uncle of the baby, who is the father's brother rushed into the room to help deliver the baby. He cut his umbilical cord and wash him. He did that with the reason to protect the baby from any bad ancestral spirit that anyone could have impacted on the baby an to also bless the baby. The baby was named Kofi Osei. Osei is the family name that he inherited from the dad. In Ghana, names are given based on the day the child was born. They believe that a child born on a particular day has certain exclusive traits, which should be reflected in their names.  Therefore, the name Kofi is a day given name for a male child born on a Friday.

                <h2> Growing up as a child</h2>
                <p>
                    Kofi Osei lived with the mum and siblings in Kumasi, in a small town called Adako Gyakye. His dad was a farmer, so he lived close to his farm with his other family in the village where he owned a piece of land. Christmas was always celebrated at the dad's place. His mum, Yaa Nimo struggled to raise eleven children on her own, she lost three children which made them eight and worked hard to take care of the eight. She was unable to cater for her children’s schooling, so they all had to work to assist their mother in paying school fees and others. At the age of six, Kofi started to work and save money to support his mother and to help him start school. The mum gave him some money to buy some kerosene, he divided the kerosine into bottles and went out to sell them. On Christmas vacations, when they are in the village with their dad, they gather kola nut from the farm and sell them. Fortunately, he one day found a large amount of money whiles taking a bath at the riveside, which was used to help him start school.

                <h2>School days</h2>
                <p>
                    During school days, he was very good at agriculture because he had learnt from his father who was a farmer. He was awarded for his excellent study and practice in agriculture. Every evening after school, he continued with his little business to support the home. He went from selling kerosine to learning to make farm baskets to sell them, which included going to the farm to cut down branches. He learnt to climb coconut trees. One day after a school football match, he and his friends went to the bush and he was asked to get some coconut from the tree. Unfortunately for him this time, he fell from on top of the tree and ended up in the hospital for three months. When he got well, he stopped making the farm baskets to doing shoe shine, which entails the polishing of peoples shoes. He then proceeded to sell toffees, gum, and biscuits at important places like the airport and the stadium. He also helped to clean the stadium with his friends and earned a bit. They allowed him to stay to watch football matches for free. 
                    The father’s side of the family knew he was familiar with the city and wouldn’t get missing, so to  help generate money for the family they sent him to take his auntie’s husband who was blind to beg for money in the city.

                <h2>Business Minded</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1979, he finished Junior Secondary school (middle school) and did not have money to continue schooling. There was a new post office been built in their town and the town leaders wanted him to be a postman which he disliked so he left town to live with a close grandma he knew.  She took him as a manager in her Hotel called Nanka memorial hotel in Amakuom Kumasi. With this job, he made enough money to start his own business. He took his first trip to Togo with his friend Kwame to pick up items and brought them to Ghana, Kumasi market to sell. From Togo, he picked items from Benin and from Nigeria. His business expanded and at the age of 25, he bought a car ( Datsun E10) and used it as a taxi. He hired someone to drive the taxi and make the money for him whiles he continued with his business. After making some money he decided to enlarge his business by getting good quality products. He sold his car, having in mind to travel abroad to pick up quality products to sell and help enlarge his business. He first invested his money in a business which went really bad and he had a loss.
