                    Back home, he had a very successful older brother and sister but he did not want to depend on their success, so he strived for his own success. July 1987, along with other six friends of his they decided to take the risk and travel to Libya by foot, which took them about two months. They took an STC state bus to Burkina Faso. From there, they continue to Mali with a jeep with was known to be a connection car. From Mali to Algeria at their first border town called Timiaouine with a recruiting jeep. From Timiaouine with another jeep they went to Tamanrasset and from there they took a car called Belet (a car that transport date palm) to Djanet. At Djanet with the dessert leaders, they went by foot for three days to cross the desert. Every morning they left early and took a stop late in the evening.They climbed the Hugo mountain and had their rest in caves at night. They picked weeds along the way to help make fire around them at night to keep away wild animals. At this point in time, they were about one hundred and twenty people crossing the desert to Ghat, Libya. Everyone had a blanket, food mostly Gari (cassava flakes and very known in West Africa), gallon of water and first aid. On the third day at 5 pm, the dessert leaders took them on top of a mountain to show them Ghat city ahead of them to cheer them up. They continued their journey that night and got to Ghat, 4 am the next morning. They hid in an uncompleted building built by the Sudanese to prevent themselves from being seen by the police. They were very tired and hungry but refused to get out because they were scared to be seen by a police. Some boys visited the building and saw that they were very hungry, they asked them to follow to a bread seller close by but they refused due to the fact that they can get caught by the police. Kofi refused to stay hungry so he followed the boys to the bread seller and when he got there, the bread seller liked his personality and decided to keep him as a worker. Kofi asked for more bread for his friends and the bread seller gave him a lot of bread to take to the others and he also asked if he could provide work for some of his friends and he accepted four of Kofi’s friends. After 2 months of working at the bakery, he decided to leave the place and to Sabha another town in Libya. There, he worked at Sherika Sebha which was a building construction and he made some money and took a plane to Benghazi, where he met a man called Bewa. Bewa was a military that sent them to Tobruk to work for him by making blocks with the machine he had purchased. Kofi made some money and moved to Tunisia for a week where he got the opportunity to go by ship Italy.
